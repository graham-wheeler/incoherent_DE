Code for Wheeler (2018): "Incoherent dose-escalation in phase I trials using the escalation with overdose control approach", Statistical Papers, 59, 801â€“811. DOI: 10.1007/s00362-016-0790-7

The code allows production of Figure 1 and Table 1, and requires R2OpenBUGS for simulating the Escalation With Overdose Control (EWOC) design studied in this paper.
